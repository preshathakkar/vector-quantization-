# K-Means Algorithm implementation for Vector Quantization of RAW image
An application to translate a RAW image into a compressed variant based on the provided Quantization Coefficient. K-Means Algorithm was incorporated to extract the most prominent shades of Grey in the image using the Coefficient. The image was then converted into its compressed version using the attained resulting shades.
